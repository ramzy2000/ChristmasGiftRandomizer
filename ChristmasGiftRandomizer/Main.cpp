/// <summary>
/// I need a application that will hold all of the group data and the methods for
/// printing out a random person match along with the ability to flag matches from occuring
/// with each other in the text document.
/// Example: Casey, Brandon
///          Brandon
/// 
/// I will have to add a int flagsVector in the person data type.
/// 
/// I will have to make the group object look at whats to the left of the comma only. Then later
/// look what name string matches with the string on the left and flag each person ID in
/// each others person flagsVector.
/// 
/// The flags will then be incorperated later when calculating the resulting matching combinations.
/// 
/// Also by default each person auto flags with the id given to them. You can't match with yourself.
